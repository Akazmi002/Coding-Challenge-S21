# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2021)

## Diagram

![screenshot](Circular_Gene.png)


## Solution

The libraries I used was ReportLab and BioPython which is used to parse the genbank file and create a genome digram. 
After creating a diagram of the genbank file, I added the color feautures to the circular gene diagram.
I then drew the diagram, configured the labels, and then saved the diagram as a PNG file.
